\subsection*{Abstract}
A path integral ground state method will be used to calculate inital conditions of a semiclassical initial value representation approach for molecular systems. 
It is hypothesised that this approach will yield accurate energy spectrums from which excited state energies can be obtained. 


\section{Introduction}
\begin{description}

    \item[Hamiltonian] \hfill \\
    Hamiltonian of a particle is:
    \begin{equation}
    	\hat{H} = \hat{K} + \hat{V}
    \end{equation}
    Form used in the Schrodinger equation:
    \begin{equation}
    	\hat{H} = \frac{-\hbar^{2}}{2m}\nabla^{2} + V(\vec{r},t)
    \end{equation}
    Restricted to potentials depending only on position:
    \begin{equation}
    	\hat{H} = \sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{\hat{p}_{i}^2}{2m_{i}} + V(\vec{q})
    \end{equation}

    \item[Time dependent Schrodinger] \hfill \\
    In general:
    \begin{equation}
    	i\hbar\dpd{}{t}\Psi = \hat{H}\Psi	
    \end{equation}
    For a single non-relativistic particle:
    \begin{equation}
    	i\hbar\dpd{}{t}\Psi(\vec{r},t) = \left[\frac{-\hbar^{2}}{2\mu}\nabla^{2} + V(\vec{r},t)\right]\Psi(\vec{r},t)
    \end{equation}

    \item[Time independent Schrodinger] \hfill \\
    In general:
    \begin{equation}
    	E\Psi = \hat{H}\Psi
    \end{equation}
    For a single non-relativistic particle:
    \begin{equation}
    	E\Psi(\vec{r}) = \left[\frac{-\hbar^{2}}{2\mu}\nabla^{2} + V(\vec{r})\right]\Psi(\vec{r})
    \end{equation}
\end{description} 


\subsection{A bit of prelude}
Accurate and efficient measurements of molecular properties, such as energy states, is an area of active research in theoretical chemistry. The literature shows many different uses for these accurate measurements, and the benefits provided by obtaining them in a timely manner[cite]. There are many different methods for calculating these values, we propose a combination of a path integral ground state method and a semiclassical method. Classical methods, such as molecular dynamics simulations, are regularly used in comercial environments[cite]. Such methods are only adequate when the properties of interest do not exhibit significant quantum effects.Quantum mechanical calculations give exact results but are very slow or impossible for certain problem sets. These are key factors driving the interest in semiclassical methods, because they are based on classical trajectories but incorporate quantum effects. Semi-classical methods can be both fast and accurate for certain problem sets. It has been shown that ground state energies, for molecular systems, can be calculated using a semiclassical method with good accuracy and speed[cite]. In the research we propose, we will combine semiclassical techniques with path integral ground state techniques (PIGS) to obtain accurate excited state energies~\cite{issack2007semiclassical}~\cite{schmidt2014inclusion}.

\section{Proposal}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Use PIGS to get $\ket{0}$
	Considering only the potentials that depend on position we can write the general Hamiltonian as:
	\begin{equation}
		\hat{H} = \hat{K} + \hat{V} = \sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{\hat{p}_{i}^2}{2m_{i}} + V(\vec{q})
	\end{equation}
	We are interested in finding the expectation value of the energy operator in the ground state. 
	This is equivalent to finding expectation values of functions with respect to the path integral distributions, which we can do by using PIGS simulations.
	We use a technique know as the Path Integral Langevin Equation (PILE) thermostat which improves the efficiency of our sampling [cite].
	The LePIGS will be preformed in three dimensions and then the mean of all dimensional quantities will used as initial conditions for the SC-IVR method. \\
	We will use the software package Molecular Modelling Toolkit (MMTK), which implements the LePIGS method, to run our simulations.\\
	A simple example of an estimator to find the energy:
	\begin{equation}
		\Braket{E} 
		= \frac{\Braket{\psiT|e^{-\beta\hat{H}}\hat{H}|\psiT}}{\Braket{\psiT|e^{-\beta\hat{H}}|\psiT}} 
		= \frac{1}{Z_{o}} \Braket{\psiT|e^{-\beta\hat{H}} \hat{H}|\psiT}
	\end{equation}
	The estimator used to find the energy will be: (our operator commutes with the Hamiltonian):
	\begin{equation}
		\Braket{O} 
		= \frac{\Braket{\psiT|e^{\frac{-\beta\hat{H}}{2}} \hat{H} e^{\frac{-\beta\hat{H}}{2}}|\psiT}}{\Braket{\psiT|e^{-\beta\hat{H}}|\psiT}} 
		= \frac{1}{Z_{o}} \Braket{\psiT|e^{\frac{zx-\beta\hat{H}}{2}} \hat{H} e^{\frac{-\beta\hat{H}}{2}}|\psiT}
	\end{equation}
	Where $\psiT$ is the approximation to the exact ground state wavefunciton. 
	A uniform trial function ($\psiT = 1$) was used due to simplicity of implementation.

	\item Use HK $\&$ to get dynamics $e^{\frac{i\hat{H}T}{\hbar}}$ \\
	SC-IVR methods are capable of describing essentially all quantum effects that are based on the phase information of the wave function.
	We chose to use the Herman-Kluck (HK) propogator instead of the Van Vleck-GutzWiller for a number of reasons:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The HK propogator is not restricted to small systems based on CT determined by initial and final positions.
		\item The HK propogator has the desired property that the coherent states are localized in coordinate $\&$ momentum space.
		\item Additionally in the $\lim_{\gamma \to \infty}$ limit HK-IVR reduces to the co-ordinate space Van Vleck-IVR [cite]. 
	\end{enumerate}
	The initial value representation (IVR) is used because it does not require solving the boundary-value problem (root search), a severe numerical challenge in a multidimensional system. \\
	The purpose of SC in the time domain is to find an appropriate description of the quantum propogator $e^{\frac{-i\hat{H}t}{\hbar}}$ 
	in terms of classical trajectories which is valid in the asymptotic limit $\lim_{\hbar \to 0}$. \\
	It does this by propogating clasical trajectories uniquely defined by their initial conditions.

	\item introduce correlation function $C(t) = \Braket{0|e^{\frac{i\hat{H}t}{\hbar}}\hat{x}e^{\frac{-i\hat{H}t}{\hbar}}\hat{x}|0} 
											   = \Braket{\hat{x}(t)\hat{x}} 
											   = e^{\frac{-iE_{0}t}{\hbar}}\Braket{0|\hat{x}e^{\frac{i\hat{H}t}{\hbar}}\hat{x}|0}$\\
	We can also express a general correlation function as follows:
	\begin{equation}
		C(t) = \frac{1}{Z}\Tr[e^{-\beta\hat{H}}\hat{B}e^{\frac{i\hat{H}t}{\hbar}}\hat{A}e^{\frac{-i\hat{H}t}{\hbar}}]
	\end{equation}
	Where $e^{-\beta\hat{H}}$ is the thermal density operator, $Z = \Tr(e^{-\beta\hat{H}})$ is the partition function and $e^{\frac{i\hat{H}t}{\hbar}}\hat{A}e^{\frac{-i\hat{H}t}{\hbar}}=\hat{A}(t)$ is the Heisenberg representation of the operator $\hat{A}$.
